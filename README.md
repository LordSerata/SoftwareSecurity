# Artemis Financial Security Assessment

## Client Overview  
Artemis Financial is a financial services company that wanted to improve the security of its software. They needed an assessment to find weaknesses in their system and recommendations on how to fix them. The main goal was to protect sensitive financial data and make sure their software followed secure coding practices.

## Software Security Vulnerabilities  
While reviewing the software, I found a few key security issues, including **weak password security, lack of input validation, and unsecured data storage**. These are common problems that could allow hackers to steal data or take control of the system. Secure coding is important because it prevents these kinds of attacks, which could lead to **data breaches, financial loss, or legal issues** for a company.

## Challenges and Insights  
One of the biggest challenges was figuring out **which vulnerabilities were the most critical** and how they could realistically be exploited. Some were easy to fix, like adding better password requirements, while others required more in-depth security changes. This project helped me understand **how attackers think** and how to prevent security risks early in development.

## How I Improved Security  
To strengthen security, I made recommendations like:  
- **Stronger password rules** to prevent weak login credentials  
- **Input validation** to stop malicious data entry (e.g., SQL injection)  
- **Data encryption** for sensitive information  
- **Access control improvements** so only authorized users can see certain data  

If I were to do another security review in the future, I’d use tools like:  
- **OWASP ZAP** (to check for common security flaws)  
- **Static code analyzers** (to find vulnerabilities in the code automatically)  
- **Penetration testing tools** (to simulate hacker attacks and test defenses)  

## Making Sure the Software Works and Stays Secure  
After making security changes, I ran tests to make sure everything still worked and no new security holes were introduced. I used **code reviews, security scans, and manual testing** to double-check that everything was functional and secure.

## Tools and Practices I Found Useful  
Some helpful tools and techniques I used in this project include:  
- **OWASP Top 10** (a guide for common security risks)  
- **Secure coding practices** (like validating user input and using encryption)  
- **Threat modeling** (thinking like an attacker to find weak points in the system)  

## Why This Project is Useful for Employers  
This project shows my ability to **find security issues in software, recommend fixes, and follow secure coding practices**. It’s a good example of my work in:  
- **Application security**  
- **Software vulnerability assessment**  
- **Improving security without breaking functionality**  

If an employer asks for a security-related project, I’d show them this because it demonstrates that I can **identify risks and improve software security** in a real-world scenario.
